## What is it?

Terra-- is a fork of Terra++ intended to strip down dependencies to Minecraft and Forge so it can be used safely in as dependency for other projects (this is not a mod).

## How to use ?

### :warning: This project is still experimental

Just add Jitpack as a maven repository to your `build.gradle`, as well as the repositories needed for Terra--'s dependencies, and declare this repository as a dependency to your own project.

E.g. :
```
repositories {
    
    // Classic JCenter repository that has most of what we need
    jcenter()
    
    // JitPack will build this repo and provide it as a dependency
    maven {
        name = "JitPack"
        url = "https://jitpack.io/"
    }
    
    // DaPorchop's repo for PorkLib
    maven {
        name = "DaPorkchop_"
        url = "https://maven.daporkchop.net/"
    }
    
    // This is for leveldb
    maven {
        name = "OpenCollab Snapshots"
        url = "https://repo.opencollab.dev/snapshot/"
    }
    
}

dependencies {

    // Include this repository as a dependency through Jitpack
    // master-SNAPSHOT indicates to use the latest commit on master,
    // you can replace this with a commit hash or a reference to anoter branch 
    compile 'com.github.SmylerMC:terraminusminus:master-SNAPSHOT'
    
    
    // Your other depencencies would go down there...
    
}
```
